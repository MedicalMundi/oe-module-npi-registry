# Quick start

1. For this project you need to have installed on your machine:

    - Bash (same here, just try `bash --version` in a terminal).
    - Git (run `git --version` to see if you already have it installed).
    - A PHP IDE, preferably PhpStorm.


2. Clone this project to your machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MedicalMundi/oe-module-npi-registry.git
    ```

3. Next, `cd` into the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

Now you are ready to work.
